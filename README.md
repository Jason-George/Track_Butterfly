# Track and Trace a Butterfly's Path.

Observing Butterflies keenly, i realised they had a tinge of randomness attached to the way they fly, for they don't necessarily fly 
in a straight line. Curious enough to track and study them, i found a few papers online that did study their flight pattern.
I wanted to try and trace their path and the usual object tracking algorithmns didn't seem to work, for they were always moving leaves and 
plants in the background. 
Thrown with a challenge, i tried to track them and i must say i have been 60% successful.
