# Track and Trace a Butterfly's Path.

Observing Butterflies keenly, i realised they had a tinge of randomness attached to the way they fly, for they don't necessarily fly 
in a straight line. Curious enough to track and study them, i found a few papers online that did study their flight pattern.
I wanted to try and trace their path and the usual object tracking algorithmns didn't seem to work, for they were always moving leaves and 
plants in the background. 

Thrown with a challenge, i tried to track them and i must say i have been about 60% successful.

Here is an example of just tracing where the motions lie in a video of a butterfly and lines being traced is the butterfly.
The double line is because of the shadow of the buterfly itself and the other spots motion pixels of leaves etc.

Here are the videos below, where the motions pixels are superimposed over the actual video.
